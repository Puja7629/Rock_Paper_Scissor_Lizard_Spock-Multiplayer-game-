# Rock_Paper_Scissor_Lizard_Spock-Multiplayer-game-
  I have created a rock paper scissors lizard spock game in Python.Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock in Python. Rock-paper-scissors is a hand game that is played by two people. The players count to three in unison and simultaneously “throw” one of three hand signals that correspond to rock, paper or scissors.
